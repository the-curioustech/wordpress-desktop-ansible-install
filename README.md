# wordpress-desktop-ansible-install
This is just a simple ansible playbook to install wordpress from tar without having to do much work.

You'll need to have python and ansible installed, but that is it!  Most distros already have python and you can check by opening the terminal and running python -v.

Once you have ansible installed and have cloned this repo you'll just need to run the following:

`ansible-playbook install-wordpress.yml`

that's it!
